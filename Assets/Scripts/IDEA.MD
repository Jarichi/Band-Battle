idea. for the countdown timer, play a sample before the note spawning begins to indicate the countdown, but also make sure the if statement in the sonh handler keeps increasing and checking when to spawn notes, as to not break the precview beat spawning.

Might be done using some array offsetting for spawning the notes by adding a constant value to every number in thearray, corresponding to the countdown time.

I wonder if bitwise operations are allowed and work on an ntire array, or if there are non-reource intensive ways of doing this.
